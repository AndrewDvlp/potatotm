# PotatoTM

Based on the work of Graphic & UI/UX designer Eldin Herić and his [Potato landing page](https://dribbble.com/shots/2042501-Potato-landing-page). I've set myself a challenge to take his design and make a working website out of it. It will allow me to implement different website building techniques and practice different language skills.

The initial code base is a variation of my [Starter-Kit-V1](https://github.com/AndrewDvlp/Starter-Kit-V1) repo and will evolve from there. The master branch will include the pre-processed code (Jade¦Sass¦JavaScript) while the processed code will be on the gh-pages branch in order to make it easily accessible.
